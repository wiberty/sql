/*
This SQL script ranks movie directors by the average rating for all their horror movies. In effect, the metric shows the consensus rating for the sum total of a director's work in the horror genre.
As an alternative metric, the highest average rating for any specific movie is provided. In some circumstances, a director might have created a great film that they are remembered for, but also some bad ones that brings down the average. The metric might be used when a directorâ€™s work varies significantly in quality.
Context is given for the averages by showing the number of ratings and number of movies included in the calculation.
The key data dependency is for the relevant movies to be correctly classified within the database as horror.
